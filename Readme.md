# Training and Trading Using Reinforcement Learning

Created based on the reinforcement learning example (actor-critic method) on the TensorFlow website.

Program Concept:

This program consists of reinforcement learning for the actor and critic networks based on the profit and loss results of buy and sell signals generated by the actor network, among two networks (actor and critic) that share a base.

The state consists of six variables. Five represent the return over a given period based on the signal in chronological order, and the final variable represents the current holding state (sell -1, neutral 0, buy 1).

Given Period 1

|Index| 340| 350| 340| 345| 355| 330 |

|State| 0.029 | -0.028 | 0.0147 | -0.0289 | 0.014 | -1 |
